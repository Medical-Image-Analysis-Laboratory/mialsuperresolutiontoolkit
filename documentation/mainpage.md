# WELCOME TO MIALSRTK SOURCE CODE DOCUMENTATION #

The Medical Image Analysis Laboratory Super-Resolution ToolKit (MIALSRTK) consists of a set of C++ image processing tools necessary to perform motion-robust super-resolution fetal MRI reconstruction. This toolkit, supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant SNSF-141283), includes all algorithms and methods for brain extraction [1], intensity standardization [1,2], motion estimation and super-resolution [2] developed during my PhD. It uses the CMake build system and depends on the open-source image processing Insight ToolKit (ITK) library, the command line parser TCLAP library and OpenMP for multi-threading. The USAGE message of each tool can be obained using either the *-h* or *--help* flag.
